# Factorio Optimization Toolkit
A collection of scripts used to create an optimized factorio speedrun plan, all in python.

### In the toolkit:
- **Factorio Wiki Scraper** (in progress) to get the quantity of all resources needed to build the rocket silo - `wikiScraper.py`

### To be added:
- **Timing calculations** to calculate how long everything will take and properly synchronize crafting with productivity modules
- **Science and research optimization** to get the resources needed to make science and determine what reasearch to prioritize
